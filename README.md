Speech Classification and Emotion Analysis Project
[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/PythonTensoro complementary machine learning projects demonstrating advanced audio and natural language processing techniques:

Speech Classification:
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model trained to classify 6 speech categories — bird, dog, cat, down, eight, and bed — using a diverse dataset sourced from Kaggle with over 1200 audio samples (200 files per category). The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 84% after 50 training epochs, showcasing robust feature extraction from audio signals.

Emotion Analysis from Twitter News:
A Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline designed to analyze text data from Twitter news feeds for emotion classification. The model achieves 75% accuracy, emphasizing the effectiveness of textual sentiment analysis on social media data.

Features
Speech Classification

Audio preprocessing and feature extraction (e.g., MFCC, spectrograms)

CNN model architecture tailored for speech recognition

Training and testing with detailed accuracy tracking

Emotion Analysis

Text preprocessing: tokenization, normalization, stopword removal

Emotion classification using NLP techniques

Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speech-emotion-analysis.git
cd speech-emotion-analysis
Install dependencies (recommended to use a virtual environment):

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download and prepare datasets according to instructions in the DATASETS.md file.

Usage
Speech Classification
Train the CNN model:

bash
python train_speech_model.py --epochs 50
Evaluate and predict on test samples:

bash
python evaluate_speech_model.py --input <audio_file>
Emotion Analysis
Run emotion classification on Twitter news data:

bash
python run_emotion_analysis.py --input <twitter_news_file>
See classification report and accuracy metrics in output.

Results
Speech model accuracy: ~84% after 50 epochs.

Emotion analysis accuracy: ~75% on Twitter news text.

The repository contains sample graphs, model checkpoints, and detailed logs.

Future Work
Integrate both pipelines for real-time emotion recognition from speech input.

Expand speech categories and dataset size to improve performance.

Deploy interactive web or mobile app interface.
